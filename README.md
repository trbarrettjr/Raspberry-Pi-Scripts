# Raspberry-Pi-Scripts
Things I have done to improve my experience with my Raspberry Pi's

## Background
Per the [documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) at Raspberry Pi's website.  You can place a wpa_supplicant.conf on the boot folder and it will automatically configure the pi for a headless system.  I had written this script to create the wpa_supplicant.conf.  This doesn't take into consideration all possibilites and will need improvement.
